Getting Started with Appium tests in Selenide on BrowserStack couldn't be easier!

### **Run Sample test :**

- Switch to one of the following directories: [Android examples](android) or [iOS examples](ios)
- Run the following maven command `mvn test -P sample-test` to run in maven enviroment.
- Run the following gradle command `gradle clean sampleTest` to run in gradle enviroment.

### **Use Local testing for apps that access resources hosted in development or testing environments :**
